# SmartWebServer
* An HTTP web server is a software application that handles HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests and responses. It serves web content to clients, typically web browsers, upon their request. When a user enters a URL in their web browser or clicks on a link, the browser sends an HTTP request to the web server, and the server responds by sending the requested content back to the client.These servers play a vital role in hosting websites, serving web content, and facilitating communication between clients and servers on the World Wide Web.
